# SmithWaterman Algorithm #

The Smith–Waterman algorithm performs local sequence alignment; that is, for determining similar regions between two strings of nucleic acid sequences or protein sequences. Instead of looking at the entire sequence, the Smith–Waterman algorithm compares segments of all possible lengths and optimizes the similarity measure. (from wiki)

For other implementation, you can take a look at my another repo "verilog_project_2020/final".
The algorithm is implemented by hardware. The time complexity can be reduced by systolic array architecture.
